                 | Started in Mumbai, the organization works with governments, corporations, partners, and volunteers 
                 | to create local chapters addressing urban and environmental challenges in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals.
                 | Food waste not only has economic and societal impacts but also puts undue pressure on natural resources 
                 | and the environment, emitting about 8% of global greenhouse gases annually.
